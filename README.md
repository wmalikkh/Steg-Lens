# Steg-Lens
StegLens is a graduation project that combines steganography and encryption in a modern web interface. Users can securely hide and extract secret messages inside images using AES-128 or 3DES encryption. Built with Python Flask and a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS frontend, the app supports PNG and JPG formats, with GIF support coming soon.
